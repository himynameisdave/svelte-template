### About

This is an extension of the default [`sveltekit`](https://kit.svelte.dev) demo project you can generate by following [the instructions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project). It extends it by providing defaults which I would almost always want in a project, as well as setting up things how I prefer them (such as including [`eslint-config-himymameisdave`](https://github.com/himynameisdave/eslint-config-himynameisdave)).

### Running

```bash
# Pick your package manager
yarn install

yarn dev
```
